# cpm — developer notes

Terminal UI (Bubble Tea) comparing Claude Code plugins and MCP servers across
profiles (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` directories). See README.md for user-facing
behavior.

## Commands

- `make build` / `make test` / `make lint` (golangci-lint) / `make run`
- Coverage bar: 80%+ on non-UI packages (`claudecli`, `config`, `model`).

## Architecture

- `internal/claudecli` — wraps the `claude` CLI behind the `Runner` interface;
  every invocation sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to the target profile. cpm never
  edits Claude's JSON files directly; all mutations go through the CLI.
- `internal/config` — profile resolution: CLI args > `~/.config/cpm/config.yaml`
  > auto-discovered `~/.claude*` directories.
- `internal/model` — pure aggregation of per-profile CLI data into comparison
  matrices; no I/O.
- `internal/ui` — Bubble Tea app: one `column` of state per profile, loads run
  async per profile, the MCP tab loads lazily on first view.

## Testing conventions

- `claudecli.FakeRunner` (in `fake.go`, not a `_test.go` file, so `config` and
  `ui` tests can inject it) returns canned responses keyed by the space-joined
  args and records every call.
- Real CLI output is captured as fixtures under `internal/claudecli/testdata/`.
- UI behavior is tested by driving `Model.Update` directly with key/load
  messages and asserting on `View()` output; no TTY needed.

## Non-obvious constraints

- `claude plugin list --available --json`: the `source` field is polymorphic —
  a plain string path or an object whose `ref` may be a branch name, not a
  version.
- `claude mcp list` has no `--json` mode and health-checks every server, so it
  is slow — hence the lazy MCP tab and tab-scoped reload. Its output includes
  project/local-scope servers (cwd-dependent) and plugin-provided servers
  (`plugin:<plugin>:<name>`), which `claude mcp remove` cannot remove.
- `claude auth status --json` may exit non-zero for logged-out profiles while
  still printing valid JSON; parseable object output wins over the exit code.
- Every UI-fired CLI call carries a timeout (`cmdTimeout` in
  `internal/ui/app.go`) so a hung `claude` degrades to a per-column error. The
  marketplace refresh gets its own 30s sub-budget (`refreshTimeout` in
  `internal/claudecli/latest.go`) so a hung git remote degrades to a stale
  catalog instead of eating the whole load budget. A timed-out *action* is
  "uncertain" — the write may have partially applied — and forces a column
  reload.
- Killing a timed-out `claude` is not enough: children it spawned (stdio MCP
  servers from `mcp list`, git from `marketplace update`) inherit the output
  pipes and keep `cmd.Run` blocked past the timeout. The runner starts each
  command in its own process group and SIGKILLs the group on cancel
  (`runner_unix.go`; `runner_other.go` is a no-op), with `WaitDelay` as the
  pipe-closing backstop.
- Only one writer per config dir at a time: a fresh profile load runs
  `plugin marketplace update` (a write), so action keys are busy-gated, reload
  skips busy/loading columns, and MCP remove is blocked during a plugin load.
  Generation stamps on load messages only drop superseded results — they
  cannot cancel an in-flight process.
- All mutations pin `--scope user`: the CLI auto-detects scope otherwise, so
  acting on a project/local-scope row (cwd-dependent, identical in every
  column) would edit config shared by all profiles. The UI additionally
  refuses plugin actions on cells whose reported scope is not `user`.
- Plugin IDs and MCP server names are third-party data passed to `claude` as
  positional args; the UI refuses names starting with `-` so they cannot be
  parsed as CLI flags.
- `claude plugin marketplace remove` without `--scope user` removes the
  marketplace from ALL scopes, not just the profile's config — cpm always
  passes it (`add` pins it too; `marketplace update` has no scope flag).
- Marketplaces have no version field, so the freshness signal is the commit
  hash/date of the clone, read by direct `git -C <installLocation> log -1`
  (not through Runner) during load. Git failure → blank cells so the UI can
  tell "unknown" from a git-less directory source (shown as `local`).
- macOS Keychain namespaces `claude` credentials by whether
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` was set at login, so the default `~/.claude` profile
  can read as logged-out under cpm even though a plain `claude` login is
  active. `loadAuth` (`internal/ui/app.go`) re-checks a clean logged-out
  answer for `IsDefault` profiles with an empty profile dir — the runner
  strips the ambient env var when the dir is empty — and a clean logged-in
  fallback wins.
- Outdated flags use a custom segment-wise numeric version compare in
  `internal/model` (leading `v` ignored, missing segment = 0, pre-release <
  release, empty never outdated, lexical fallback for non-numeric segments) —
  not a semver library, which would reject real-world refs like `1.2.3.4`.
